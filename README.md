# TxRx BPSK Modulation
This project involves implementing a digital communication system for transmitting a text file using BPSK/QPSK modulation. Two LimeSDR boards will be used: one for transmission and the other one for reception.

# Objectives
1. Uploading of different types of files for subsequent processing.
2. Modulation of a text file using BPSK in block diagramming software (such as GNU Radio).
3. Integrate the hardware, being the LimeSDR device to develop a correct transmission and reception. Both with their respective modulation and demodulation.

- Interpolation
- Decimation

# Procedure
Both transmitter and receiver were created with block designs on GNU Radio, based on the following links:

# Results


# Findings
- It was incurred in a gain problem. The error statement referred to low gain usage, where "device_handler::set_gain()" was 6dB. However, the Tx needed 40 dB.
